# LeetCode Solutions

My solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by data structure and algorithm.

## Structure

- Each problem has its own file with comprehensive documentation
- Problems are organized by category (e.g., arrays, binary search)
- Each solution includes approach explanation, complexity analysis, and test cases

## Categories

- [Array Problems](./problems/array/)

- [Dynamic Programming](./problems/dynamic_programming/)
- [Graph](./problems/graph/)
- [Linked List](./problems/linked_list/)
- [String](./problems/string/)
- [Tree](./problems/tree/)
